# doug-news

## To install locally

(This will install the react app only, to install the backend go to my repo [here](https://github.com/douglashellowell/nc-news))

### Prerequisites:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[git](https://git-scm.com/)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

To install download the repo and install with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/douglashellowell/doug-news-FE.git
cd ./doug-news-FE

This app is a culmination of the skills and knowledge gained from the first 3 blocks of the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp

#### Future Plans:

- Revisualise the design
- Add article endpoint on backend and frontend
- Edit comment/article options
- User stats - what's your most voted on/commented on submission?
- Distinct Tablet style
